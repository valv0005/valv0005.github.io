            <p>
                Hi everyone! My name is Amalia Valverde an International student of Mexican nationality.
                At the moment, I am starting the Interactive Media Design program (Delivered on September 7<sup>th</sup>,2021)
                at Algonquin College and I hope I can have successful grades at every level of this program. 
                I can communicate effectively in <em>Spanish</em> and <em>English</em>, both written and oral.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have a Bachelor's degree in Communication from <abbr title="Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon">UANL</abbr>, 
                a University located in Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, Mexico. I have 10 years of experience in the corporate office environment. 
                By the time I am being developed communication skills,  I've been working well with others and, I have been able to make 
                important decisions in the workplace. 
            </p>
